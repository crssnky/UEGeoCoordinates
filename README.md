This branch is not official(EpicGames).  
If you want to try `UEGeoCoordinates` with HoloLens2, you should try UE4.27 and [GeoReferencingPlugin](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/4.27/Engine/Plugins/Runtime/GeoReferencing).  
EpicGames replaced `UEGeoCoordinates` with `GeoReferencingPlugin`.  
It has ARM64 build libraries.
