build and copy here libs.
- proj.lib(https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ.git)  
I use CMake. CMake outputs VS2019 sln with ARM64 conf. 
- sqlite3.lib(https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite.git)  
I use nmake(Please read sqlite's README.md).  
My build env is Win10 x64. If you too, lemon.exe and mkkeywordhash.exe have to be built by x64. 
- tiff.lib(https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff.git)  
I use CMake too. CMake outputs VS2019 sln with ARM64 conf.
